## About

I'm so happy about this project! üéâ
It might not be technically the most innovative one, BUT, I learned so much from it. Specially because **I first made it with vanilla JS.** Recreating it with React was undoubtly an eye opener. I always knew how React was powerful, but it's a whole other thing actually comparing it to vanilla JS. I managed to go further with it, and it was easier to code as well. It was definitely an improvement, and I hope you like it!

**Please give me feedback and suggestions!**

As for what I learned, I used **useEffect** in many other ways other than fetching from an API, so it was nice to grasp more of its breadth. I also dabbed in trying to make my components more reusable, with the Warning component.

As for issues, I had problems with **localStorage/JSON.parse** which troubled me for a while. It worked flawlessly in development, but in production, it caused a lot of issues. Identifying the problem was tricky, as I had to dig a lot! In the end it was a silly problem, but slippery enough. Those problems that fly under the radar are hard to track, but I'm just happy I could fix it eventually!

**If I have the time to keep working on this,** I'd think it could be nice to add more visual feedback to the form, and maybe add a search bar. Also, add more filters, such as changing the order of the list.
If I were to take one step further, I'd add a user authentication system, as to being able to sync the data between devices.
